# Refactoring Kata

This kata has been written in Java by K. Scott Allen: [https://github.com/OdeToCode/Katas](https://github.com/OdeToCode/Katas)


Here is the bad news: you got to work on some terrible, atrocious legacy code. 
The good news: at least there are unit tests to prove the code is working.

You job is to refactor the code towards clean code, while keeping the code in working order (pass all tests).

The primary goal is to refactor the code in src/ – as it stands the code is incomprehensible.

Anything is fair game, create new classes, new methods, and rename tests. The only restriction is that the existing tests have to keep working. Lean on the tests and run them after every small change to make sure you are on the right path.
Feel free to add more tests.

Commit after every small step so we can walk through the steps in the telephone interview. 

You can stop when you feel the code is good enough, something you can come back to in 6 months and understand.
